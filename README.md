### LightBank for Modo 801 Linux

LightBank is an experimental kit for configuring multiple lights easily, gathering common controls into a concise interface. It was originally designed as a testbed for creating PySide-based Custom Viewports in Modo 801 on Linux. The feature set is deliberately restricted and would likely be of limited use for actual production. The primary goals of this kit are...
* to implement a Qt-based Custom Viewport
* to allow a two-way flow when adjusting channel values (changes in the scene get reflected in the custom viewport, and vice-versa) through a Scene Item Listener
* to offer some degree of practical application
* to be distributed as a self-contained kit
